Welcome to nlglib's documentation!
==================================

NLGlib is a library for natural language generation (NLG) written in Python.
It seeks to fill a gap in the NLG field. There are currently no off-the-shelf
libraries that one could take and incorporate into other projects.
The aim of this library is to be useful for general projects that would like
to add a bit of text generation to their capabilities.
