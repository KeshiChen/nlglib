Issue: The parser can't cope with more than 5 quantifiers in a formula.

add type of expression to Expr and deduce the type from syntax (EXPR_TERM, ...)
add __len__ to Expr (1 for terms, sum of args for rest? or count ops as well/only?)

When PlaceHolder is used on its own, it does not replace the variable.

add variable context for FOL to NLG
add REG context

allow latex formulas?


BUG: SimpleNLG accepts 'NEGATED'='true' but not 'NEGATED'='TRUE'

write simplenlg realiser and str realiser -- allow setting aggregation, REG, etc.

Test hashing.
