Issue: The parser can't cope with more than 5 quantifiers in a formula.

add type of expression to Expr and deduce the type from syntax (EXPR_TERM, ...)
add __len__ to Expr (1 for terms, sum of args for rest? or count ops as well/only?)

When PlaceHolder is used on its own, it does not replace the variable.

add variable context for FOL to NLG
add REG context

allow latex formulas?

In SimpleNLG realisation change string back to non-html encode:
At(roman, work) âˆ§ At(sharon, work)
At%28roman%2C+work%29 and At%28sharon%2C+work%29

BUG: SimpleNLG accepts 'NEGATED'='true' but not 'NEGATED'='TRUE'

write simplenlg realiser and str realiser -- allow setting aggregation, REG, etc.

Test hashing.
