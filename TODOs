Issue: The parser can't cope with more than 5 quantifiers in a formula.

Issues:
∃ x, y, p: (x ≠ y) ∧ At(p, x) ↔ ~At(p, y)
∀ x, y, p: ((x ≠ y) ∧ House(x) ∧ House(y)) → (At(p, x) → ~At(p, y))

∀ x: Clean(x) ∧ Rich(x) → Happy(x) ∧ Satisfied(x) 
  -- coordinated element in complement uses 'that' instead of 'then' as a complementiser
  -- aggregation cannot handle this

add type of expression to Expr and deduce the type from syntax (EXPR_TERM, ...)
add __len__ to Expr (1 for terms, sum of args for rest? or count ops as well/only?)

When PlaceHolder is used on its own, it does not replace the variable.

add variable context for FOL to NLG
add REG context

allow latex formulas?


BUG: SimpleNLG accepts 'NEGATED'='true' but not 'NEGATED'='TRUE'

write simplenlg realiser and str realiser -- allow setting aggregation, REG, etc.

Test hashing.
